# Mango
Mango is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with Vulkan - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time Vulkan rendering with a great UI library to build desktop applications.

## Requirements
Visual Studio 2022 (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)

Vulkan SDK (preferably a recent version)
